# **Week 7 Reflective Writing**

## Author: Chong Jing Yung

In the previous week, our group delivered our mock presentation, and in overall, my teammates performed quite well.
Personally, however, I felt somewhat disappointed because my performance did not meet my own expectations.
Due to nervousness, I was unable to express myself as clearly or confidently as I had hoped. Nonetheless,
this experience was valuable, as it revealed some of my weaknesses. It also made me realize that I lack sufficient
experience in such formal settings, which naturally leads to anxiety. This suggests that I need to devote more time
to practice and preparation in order to improve.

As the semester has already entered its second half, the time remaining is limited. It is crucial for us to accelerate
our work on the final project, particularly in coding and in developing a deeper understanding of the data. Preparing possible
questions for ourselves will also be important, since both the audience and our supervisors are likely to raise critical
inquiries. Anticipating such questions will help us become more confident and better prepared.

For the next presentation, I aim to learn from my past mistakes and improve my performance. I hope to demonstrate greater
confidence, contribute more effectively to the group, and ensure that I do not hinder my teammates. Ultimately, I see these
presentations as opportunities for growth, and I am determined to use them to strengthen my skills and maturity.
