# **Reflective Writing Week 9**
# Author: Chong Jing Yung

As the semester comes to an end, our group has been refining our code and improving the visual quality of our diagram to make them more meaningful and easier to interpret. Through this process, I have learned a lot from collaboration and recognized my own weaknesses, which I have gradually corrected.

At first, I felt uncertain about my understanding of the machine learning algorithms introduced in our studio sessions. However, with our tutor’s clear explanations of each algorithm’s purpose and implementation, I gained deeper insight into their strengths and limitations. This experience not only expanded my knowledge but also sparked my interest in the field of machine learning.

Looking back, I am proud of our teamwork and the progress we made. The project improved both my technical ability and my communication skills. I also realized that I still have more to learn to fully grasp complex algorithms.

In the future, I plan to study more advanced topics, seek guidance from experienced mentors, and work harder to strengthen my understanding. I hope to maintain curiosity and perseverance, continuing to learn from every experience and apply this knowledge to future challenges.
