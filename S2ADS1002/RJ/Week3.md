# **Week 1 Reflective Writing**

## Author: Chong Jing Yung

Entering the third week, our final project progress has accelerated noticeably compared to the previous semester. This affords us valuable time for revisions and allows deeper engagement with supervisor feedback. This week’s lectures covered essential machine learning concepts—ROC AUC curves and gradient descent—reinforcing their theoretical and practical relevance to our project.

I feel a sense of steadiness, yet remain conscious of the need to sustain our current efficiency amid potential increases in workload and complexity. Adaptability will be crucial moving forward. Team collaboration continues to reveal diverse approaches: some members prioritize rapid execution, while others emphasize rigorous quality. Balancing these styles enhances our collective output.

Personally, I aim to stay aligned with the course pace while strengthening practical implementation and logical reasoning skills. I also plan to reduce dependency on AI tools, focusing instead on deeper conceptual understanding and hands-on problem-solving.
