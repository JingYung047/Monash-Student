# **Week 5 Reflective Writing**

## Author: Chong Jing Yung

Over the past five weeks, nearly half of the semester has passed, and I can feel that both the course expectations and my own standards are rising. With the final project requirements set at a higher level, we are increasingly encouraged to apply the concepts we have learned. This week’s focus has shifted more toward practical application rather than theoretical discussion, which I find especially valuable for developing real-world skills.

As the workload grows, I notice that I am placing more pressure on myself, but also setting higher expectations. In the beginning, it was enough to simply understand the material. Now, I feel a stronger need to explore how to apply knowledge in concrete ways. This change has shown me that there is still much room for improvement in my learning journey.

Within my project team, I have also come to appreciate the different strengths and weaknesses of each member. We support one another by offering encouragement and by learning from one another’s perspectives. This has given me both motivation and confidence in facing challenges.

Looking ahead, I hope I will not settle for being average, but instead aim to do better. I plan to consult tutors more actively to gain practical skills that can be applied beyond the classroom. At the same time, I must continue to improve my ability to complete tasks independently. These goals will help me strengthen both my academic performance and my personal growth.
