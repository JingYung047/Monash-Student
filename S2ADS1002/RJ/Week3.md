# **Week 3 Reflective Writing**

## Author: Chong Jing Yung

As we enter the third week of the semester, our final project has progressed at a markedly faster pace compared to the previous semester. This accelerated momentum has provided the team with a valuable opportunity to engage in more deliberate iterations and to incorporate detailed feedback from our lecturer in a much more meaningful way. This week's content has focused on the fundamental machine learning concepts, particularly ROC AUC curves for classification model and the mechanics of gradient descent optimization. While familiar, these topics took on renewed significance when considered within the specific demands of our project.

I find myself in a state of cautious confidence, appreciative of our progress yet mindful of the need to maintain discipline. The coming weeks may bring increased complexity and expanded requirements, necessitating both flexibility and sustained effort. Within the team, I observe distinct approaches to collaborationâ€”some members lean toward agile execution, while others prioritize meticulous validation of outcomes. This diversity in perspective, though occasionally challenging, ultimately contributes to a more well-rounded process.

Looking ahead, my personal focus is twofold to ensure I remain fully aligned with the course's conceptual progression, and to actively develop a more self-reliant, practice-oriented understanding of model building. This involves consciously limiting my use of automated AI tools in favor of hands-on coding and reasoned experimentation, strengthening both my technical intuition and problem-solving independence.
