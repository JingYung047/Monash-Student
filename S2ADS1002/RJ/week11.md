# *Reflective Journal Week 11*

## *Author: Chong Jing Yung*

As the final week arrived, our team successfully completed all project requirements and delivered our final presentation in Week 11. I felt an immense sense of relief and satisfaction, as this moment marked the culmination of weeks of preparation and effort. Compared to the mock presentation, our performance had clearly improved â€” each member demonstrated greater confidence and fluency. This progress was a result of our extensive practice sessions, which not only enhanced our self-assurance but also helped us control the total presentation time effectively. Ultimately, we managed to complete our presentation within 9 minutes and 47 seconds, staying well within the 10-minute limit.

Although the presentation went smoothly, there were still aspects that required improvement. For instance, when faced with thought-provoking questions from the audience, we occasionally struggled to provide immediate and logical responses. This revealed a gap in our preparation and critical thinking under pressure. Moving forward, I aim to reflect deeply on such experiences, learn from every shortcoming, and actively seek feedback from peers. By doing so, I hope to further develop my presentation skills and become a more confident and competent communicator in future semesters.
