Having replenished my energy during the break, I now approach the new semester ready to face its 
intensified challenges with deliberate preparation. In this semester, I’ve mentally prepared myself in advance.
On the first day of class, we didn’t cover any new content but instead reviewed content from the previous
semester to ensure a smoother understanding of upcoming lessons. In addition, we have formed groups for the 
Final Project as well as new teammates and a new topic come, which will surely make this semester interesting
and challenging.

I feel excited about the opportunity to learn more complex concepts within the class and apply them in real-world
scenarios. Even if the challenges seem daunting, I’m eager to push myself and strive for excellence. Working with new 
teammates will also allow me to collaborate with different people, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
Learning how to leverage their strengths and compensate for weaknesses is another new challenge, but after my
experiences last semester, I feel much more confident.

Before the beginning of this semester, I’ve already familiarized myself with the course content and completed some 
preliminary review to help me grasp concepts faster. I’ve also set a daily study routine to ensure I keep up 
with the pace of the classes. Meanwhile, we’ve started planning the division of different tasks for the Final Project,
particularly in selecting subtopics based on our individual strengths in this week.

This semester, I aim to work even harder and be more diligent than before, putting in the effort to achieve 
my desired results. I also plan to avoid repeating the mistakes I made last semester, ensuring steady progress
toward a great result.
